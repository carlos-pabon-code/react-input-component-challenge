## Overview

![screenshot](./public/overview.gif)

The steps I made to accomplish the challenge started with the creation of the components, after that I create the structure of the challenge (JSX), then I searched and organized all the resources I needed (Colors,fonts and icons), then I continue with the creation of the css required, I used styled components. Finally, I added the logic and code to the interactive components.

I used React.js, I learned to work faster than before and more organized, the design in figma makes things easier. I had to learn to use the pseudo class focus-within, to accomplish the change of color of the label and the helper text on focus.
